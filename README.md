# NLP

Mostly skeleton code right now. You can run answer.py to see the simple word stem matching approach, which is mostly matching the correct sentences.

All the training data is in the data folder. I hand-generated some questions, which should go into the questions folder in the same directory/filename structure as the data, i.e. the questions for data/set1/a1.txt should be in questions/set1/a1.txt. 

There needs to be some way of tracking progress (in question-answering), which currently doesn't exist. I wasn't really sure how to do it - some kind of spreadsheet? Just do it if you have an idea and explain how in this readme.

Comment your code pls
